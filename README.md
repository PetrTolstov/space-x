# Technical task SpaceX
## Briefly
This project as a whole took me 6 hours divided into several days. Initially, I focused on functionality, and later added styles and adapted

## Tools Used
The application is built on create-react-app using TypeScript. I decided not to use the UI libraries and wrote all the styles in vanilla css, using only a modular structure. However, for storing boxes, I decided to use MobX Store for its ease of unfolding. Also in the project there are tests for the calcBays.ts function, the test shows how the function works
